Basically, the 0.2 includes the if conditional from a 0.1 version.

code removed:
- alert for win, loose and choose.

code implemented:
- addEventListener with the purpose to be more visual using images
- Also, is possible change the image with a target.id (the button has it)
- function change():
  - the function is called when the button is actioned and ask if the user want to see a new look in the rock, paper and scissors
- add textContent in the title of the game in accordance with the if conditional for the win or loose



the sprites are made for me (follow me in devianart as Rafitorch)
